# Bank Access Analysis

Financial Inclusion remains one of the main obstacles to economic and human development in Africa. For example, across Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda only 9.1 million adults (or 13.9% of the adult population) have access to or use a commercial bank account.

Traditionally, access to bank accounts has been regarded as an indicator of financial inclusion. Despite the proliferation of mobile money in Africa and the growth of innovative fintech solutions, banks still play a pivotal role in facilitating access to financial services. Access to bank accounts enables households to save and facilitate payments while also helping businesses build up their credit-worthiness and improve their access to other financial services. Therefore, access to bank accounts is an essential contributor to long-term economic growth.

Inorder to figure out how we can predict which individuals are most likely to have or use a bank account, an understanding of the state of financial inclusion in Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda is required,as well as an identification some of the key demographic factors that might drive individualsâ€™ financial outcomes.

## Objectives
- Determine the state of financial inclusion in selected countries based on number of individuals with bank accounts
- Identify key demographic factors that influence whether an individual has a bank account or not.
- Build a classification model that predicts if an individual has a bank account or not using identified demographic factors.

## Data Description
The data used for analysis contains demographic information and what financial services are used by individuals across East Africa. This data was extracted from various Finscope surveys ranging from 2016 to 2018 and is relevant for analysis.
